Q1). Difference between let and var.
Ans)  The main difference is scoping rules.
                i) var keyword used to assign global variable and accessible by any functions.
                            example: 
                                             
    			console.log(x);
			var x=5;
			console.log(x);
			Output:
			undefined
			5
               ii) let keyword used to assign local variable and it can only be accesible inside the function.
                            example:
                                                 console.log(x);
                                                 let x=5;
			console.log(x);
			Output:
			Error

Q2.) Why are null, array printed as object type in console.
Ans) A null is an object. Its type is object . null is a special value meaning "no value.In JavaScript, arrays are technically objects; just         with special behaviours and abilities. For example, arrays have a Array. ... To differentiate an Array object from an Object                   object, we can use the Array.
